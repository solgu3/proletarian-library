                <div class="text section">
                    <p><strong>We, the participants in the Alternative Palestinian Path (Masar Badil) Conference, held under the auspices of the Palestinian people and their national flag in Beirut, Madrid and Sao Paulo, between 30 October and 2 November, 2021, and after saluting the souls of the martyrs, the sacrifices of the wounded and the struggles of the Palestinian prisoners' movement, we announce the following decisions and positions: </strong></p>
                    <p><strong>First</strong>: The conference announces the launch of the <strong>Alternative Palestinian Revolutionary Path Movement</strong>, a radical popular political movement established by Palestin&shy;ian, Arab and international will on 1 November 2021 to be a framework and a popular resistance movement confronting Zionist colonialism and the project of liquidation and surrender.</p>
                    <p>It is a movement to defend the legitimate rights of the Palestinian Arab people against the forces of imperialism, Zionism and reactionary regimes, and to participate alongside the sons and daughters of our people in the process of the national and social liberation struggle for return and liberation.</p>
                    <p><strong>Second</strong>: Acting to develop Palestinian student work and supporting it politically, socially, intellectually and financially. Accordingly, it was decided to <strong>organize the Palestinian student conference in 2022 in order to awaken the Palestinian student movement</strong>.</p>
                    <p>In this context, we call on the students of Palestine to cooperate and unite in order to liberate themselves from the influence of intellectual domination and material extortion, and we also call upon them to struggle to achieve the unity of our struggling student movement and to develop its central and leading role as one of the pillars of the Palestinian revolutionary struggle for liberation and an advanced popular base of the Palestinian, Arab and international liberation movement.</p>
                    <p><strong>Third</strong>: Organizing <strong>annual youth camps</strong> dealing with struggle, educational, scientific and sports programs, and working to develop a new revolutionary discourse that stimulates the minds and addresses the issues of young people. In this context, we will also work to promote joint action between youth and student movements and the women's movement throughout the diaspora. These annual summer camps will serve as nuclei for dialogue and a school for the revolutionary youth cadre.</p>
                    <p><strong>Fourth</strong>: Organizing a national and popular campaign to bring down the so-called "Palestinian Authority" and work to liberate the institutions of our Palestinian people from the grip of the minority class sector that dominates Palestinian political decision-making.</p>
                    <p>Our conference considers the Palestine Liberation Orga&shy;nization to be a confiscated and hijacked Palestinian institution, whose decisions and institutions are dominated by a corrupt class sector, an agent of Zionist colonialism, and a weak leadership that lacks revolutionary, popular and legal legitimacy. On this basis, we consider that the PLO and its leadership, in their current form, do not represent us and cannot represent the struggles and rights of our people.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, the conference calls on all forces, associations and popular organizations participating in the Palestinian Revolutionary Path movement to escalate the pace of mass struggle inside and outside occupied Palestine and work to confront the liquidationist project of "self-rule administration" on the road toward isolating and toppling it.</p>
                    <p><strong>Fifth</strong>: Supporting independent national institutions and enabling them to combat conditional and suspicious funding, and establishing a <strong>network of Palestine Centers</strong> in a number of Arab and international cities, camps and capitals, specifically in regions and countries where there are no centers and clubs for participants within the framework of the Masar Badil.</p>
                    <p>These new centers will be announced successively, and their achievement will be done gradually within the period of the first five-year plan (2022-2027) approved by our conference. The "Palestine Center" in each country shall be a headquarters for popular action and democratic revolutionary unions and organizations, and a legal umbrella for institutions and associations affiliated with the Alternative Palestinian Revolutionary Path Movement.</p>
                    <p><strong>Sixth</strong>: Considering 15 May of each year as a day to escalate the national, Arab and international struggle for return and liberation. The establishment of the Zionist entity in Palestine is a major crime involving international colonial powers that have not yet paid the price for their crime. Britain refuses until this moment to even apologize to our people for the ominous Balfour Declaration, whose anniversary falls today, 2 November 2021, and still refuses to assume its historical, political and moral responsibility or recognize the documented and bloody crimes it committed that began in 1917 and established the ongoing catastrophe of our Palestinian people since 1948.</p>
                    <p>15 May is a day of Palestinian, Arab and international struggle to mobilize global solidarity with the legitimate and inalienable rights of our people and with our continuing revolution to achieve our people's project of liberation and return.</p>
                    <p><strong>Seventh</strong>: Considering 1 November of each year as a day to renew the launch of our alternative revolutionary path, an annual occasion for evaluation, criticism, development and correction, and an opportunity to draw lessons gained through practical experience and militant practice on the streets.</p>
                    <p>The launch of the Alternative Revolutionary Path movement coincides with the anniversary of the launch of the Algerian liberation revolution that defeated French colonialism after 132 years of fighting and steadfastness. This glorious, immortal revolution that started on 1 November 1954 is for us a model and a guide in confronting the Zionist colonial project until the achievement of all of the goals and national aspirations of our people.</p>
                    <p><strong>Eighth</strong>: The immediate launch of organizing open and continuous tours for direct communication with all the sites and locations of our people throughout the homeland and in the five continents through national visits and events that enhance the strength of the Palestinian presence at the Arab and international levels.</p>
                    <p><strong>Ninth</strong>: Developing the political, social, economic and cultural boycott of the Zionist entity, combatting normalization and those calling for it, and exercising all forms of popular pressure on the embassies of complicit regimes and countries around the world.</p>
                    <p>We call for a comprehensive boycott and are committed to confronting the approach of normalization with the institutions and entity of the enemy, and at the same time seek to strengthen our relationships of struggle and our human bonds with various anti-Zionist, anti-racist and anti-colonial forces and personalities of all ethnic and religious and affiliations, that support the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, first and foremost the right of return and the right to self-determination over the entire Palestinian national territory, in order to establish a just and democratic society free of Zionism, racism and class exploitation.</p>
                    <p><strong>Tenth</strong>: The permanent affirmation of the right of return for Palestinian refugees as the core of our people's cause and the right of the Palestinian people, and working to establish it as a priority of struggle in the program of the Arab and international boycott movements and the forces of solidarity with the Palestinian people. In this context, we also call for putting pressure on UNRWA to not respond or adapt to the policies and positions of funders that contradict or undermine the fundamental national rights of the Palestinian people.</p>
                    <p>On the day of our launch, we salute the whole struggle of our Palestinian people in all their places of residence, and all the resistance forces in Palestine. We also salute the struggle of the Palestinian prisoners' movement, the leadership of our people's struggle in the occupied land, and the revolutionary school from which we derive all the determination and will to continue on the path until freedom and decisive victory are reached.</p>
                    <p class="strong">Long live the struggle of our Palestinian people everywhere!<br><br>
                        No voice is louder than the voice of the Palestinian people!<br><br>
                        Glory to the martyrs, freedom to the prisoners!<br><br>
                        We shall return and be victorious!</p>

                <div class="text section">
                    <p>Over the course of four days, the Alternative Palestinian Path Conference (Masar Badil Conference) was convened in the Spanish capital, Madrid. This coincided with the 30<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the infamous Madrid liquidation conference in 1991 and as a practical and popular response to the catastrophic path of Oslo and its consequences, in order to confront the policies of Zionist colonialism and regimes of surrender and normalization.</p>
                    <p><strong>The participants in the conference adopted the following political positions:</strong></p>
                    <p>Our Palestinian people, who have been fighting the national liberation battle for 104 years confronting Zionist settler colonialism, are aware, through their long experience of struggle of the importance of Palestinian popular unity in the fields of struggle, fighting, and resistance, and the need for consensus on direct goals and general strategy that protects its struggle, preserves its achievements, and preserves its identity, unity, dignity, and national rights.</p>
                    <p>On the basis of this firm understanding, we call upon the Palestinian resistance forces, the various national and popular bodies, the youth, student and feminist movements, the boycott and anti-normalization committees and all the masses of our struggling people in the occupied homeland and throughout the Diaspora to unite nationally to establish a united Palestinian national front to resist racist Zionist settler colonialism in all of Palestine, to confront the Zionist movement and its allies in the world, and to work to break all the cycles of siege by developing the ability of our Palestinian people to restore and liberate their institutions, and to strengthen the position and role of the Palestinian liberation movement and its active presence in the Arab and international arenas.</p>
                    <p>Our conference considers the Palestine Liberation Organ&shy;ization to be a confiscated and hijacked institution, whose decision-making is dominated by a corrupt class sector, acting as agents of Zionist colonialism, and a weak leadership lacking revolutionary, popular or legal legitimacy. On this basis, we consider that the Organization and its leadership, in their current form, do not represent us and cannot represent the struggles and rights of our people.</p>
                    <p>The conference therefore calls on all popular forces, associations and organizations affiliated with the Alternative Palestinian Revolutionary Path Movement to escalate the pace of mass struggle inside and outside occupied Palestine and to confront the "self-rule administration" liquidation project on the road to isolating and overthrowing it.</p>
                    <p>The Alternative Palestinian Revolutionary Path Movement is committed to working to escalate the political and public struggle, and the struggle in the fields of confrontation, against the approach of liquidation and surrender, which began with and was embodied in the signing of the Camp David Accords in 1978 between the Sadat regime and the Zionist entity under American auspices, and to confront the results of the Madrid-Oslo stage, the 1994 Wadi Araba agreement, and all the economic and security agreements signed between reactionary poles in the official Arab regimes with the Zionist entity, the latest of which is the so-called "Abraham Agreements". We consider them invalid and illegitimate agreements and treaties.</p>
                    <p>The Alternative Palestinian Revolutionary Path Movement emphasizes the need to strengthen the unity of the resistance camp in Palestine, the Arab region, and the world, which includes multiple political and intellectual movements and embraces the various colors of the Arab and Islamic spectrum from the ocean to the Gulf. Only this popular camp is capable of confronting the forces of colonialism, imperialism, racism and exploitation, accomplishing the project of return, liberating the Palestinian and Arab lands, and overthrowing the approach of surrender and normalization led by the United States and the reactionary regimes and their agents in the region.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, we affirm that the task of developing the capacity of the resistance camp and the cohesion of our internal front requires frank internal dialogue between its various national and social currents and poles in a way that serves the liberation of our peoples from the tyranny of external domination and from regimes of oppression and tyranny at home, and to achieve complete national independence. This enhances the ability of peoples to protect their national wealth and capabilities and to safeguard civil peace in our great Arab homeland, from the ocean to the Gulf.</p>
                    <p>We reaffirm our firm and fundamental position on the necessity of respecting the struggle of Palestinian women and the active participation of Palestinian women, and respecting their central leadership role in the Palestinian struggle and in the Palestinian national movement, on the path to achieving full participation and equality within the framework of our national and social liberation project.</p>
                    <p>The holding of our popular conference in Beirut, Madrid and Sao Paulo, under the banner of Palestine and under the auspices of our struggling people, 30 years after the 1991 Madrid liquidation conference and 28 years after the disastrous, treacherous Oslo Agreement of 1993, and the organization of our popular and international march that was launched under the slogan <strong>"All Palestine from the river to the sea,"</strong> our documented, declared positions, and the culture of self-reliance, are all evidences that confirm the correctness of the clear compass of struggle of our new revolutionary path in confronting the forces of Zionist colonialism and the project of surrender.</p>
                    <p>We are committed to confronting the approach of normalization with the institutions and the enemy entity. At the same time, we affirm the strengthening of relations of struggle with the various militant Jewish forces and personalities, anti-Zionist and anti-racist, and supportive of the rights of our people and their valiant resistance to liberate all of Palestine and the establishment of a democratic society in all of Palestine based on justice and equality: A society free from class exploitation, racism and Zionism.</p>
                    <p>The Palestinian revolutionary approach with Arab and international dimensions, whose features were drawn by thousands of Palestinian, Arab and international martyrs over decades of struggle, is the path of radical change that interprets reality in order to change it, understands the challenges and national and local specificities in every Palestinian community and sees them as a source of strength and pluralism. We adhere to our rights and roots while looking to the future and keeping pace with the times. This revolutionary approach is rising today to walk confidently and with steady steps toward liberated Palestine... towards a new Arab and human dawn.</p>
                    <p>On the day of our launch, we salute the whole struggle of our Palestinian people in all their places of residence, and all the resistance forces in Palestine. We also salute the struggle of the Palestinian prisoners' movement, the leadership of our people's struggle in the occupied land, and the revolutionary school from which we derive all the determination and will to continue on the path until we obtain our freedom and reach our decisive victory.</p>
                    <p class="strong">Long live the struggle of our Palestinian people everywhere!<br><br>
                        No voice is louder than the voice of the Palestinian people!<br><br>
                        Glory to the martyrs, freedom to the prisoners!<br><br>
                        We shall return and be victorious!</p>

                    <p>In mid-May every year, the Palestinian people inside Palestine and in exile and diaspora come together as one to reaffirm their right to life, to return and liberation, to express their revolutionary insistence and unbreakable iron will, determined to achieve all of their national goals and aspirations. They shout loudly in one clear voice: <strong>we are steadfast, returning, victorious.</strong></p>
                    <p>This year, our Palestinian people will come out in the village of Mayar in occupied Palestine '48, from Palestinian Jerusalem, from the rising West Bank and the valiant Gaza, through the camps in Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, and in all of the Palestinian communities in exile and diaspora. We will be unified and integrated despite the wounds, torment and siege renewed each year, with our collective goal and aspiration embodied under the Palestinian flag, for one liberated Palestine, from the river to the sea.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the numerous actions and demonstration throughout Palestine and in the Arab world, dozens of European, North American, Latin American, Australian, Asian and African cities and capitals will witness widespread popular demonstrations and actions through which the Palestinian people â€” and with them, the forces of liberation and solidarity, and the supporters of Palestine around the world â€” will renew their pledge to the martyrs, the prisoners and the wounded, their adherence to their sacred right to return to their homeland and their homes.</p>
                    <p>Some of the cities that will host events include: Vienna, London, Liverpool, Waterloo, Guelph, Paris, Toulouse, Bonn, Frankfurt, Dublin, Rome, Pretoria, Melbourne, Sydney, Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver, Ottawa, Winnipeg, Copen&shy;hagen, Berlin, Cologne, Mannheim, Tubingen, Bologna, Napoli, Amsterdam, Auckland, Madrid, Gothenburg, Malmo, Dear&shy;born, Detroit, New York, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, Nashville, Chicago, Paterson, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Portland, Austin, Raleigh, San Francisco, Seattle, Washington, DC, and others.</p>
                    <p>Historically, the Palestinian revolution named this day, the <strong>Day of Palestinian Struggle.</strong> May 15 was a day of Arab revolutionary struggle and international solidarity with the Palestinian people and their liberation movement, and a day when the democratic and progressive forces of the world affirmed their support for the legitimate, inalienable rights of the Palestinian people. In the Masar Badil, the Palestinian Alternative Revolutionary Path Movement, we must reclaim this name and the slogan, to reconsider and reaffirm the essence and meaning of May 15, the commemoration of the Palestinian Nakba, as a Palestinian, Arab and international day of struggle for return and liberation.</p>
                    <p>This May 15 comes one year after the launch of the great Palestinian popular Unity Intifada, the Battle of Seif al-Quds, which our valiant Palestinian people fought for 11 days in a heroic confrontation against the racist settler-colonial Zionist project, when the struggling Palestinian masses rose up with weapons, stones, Molotov cocktails and fists, bringing their calls for revolution, their bodies, and all they had to fight to confront the U.S.-Zionist war machine and the killing gangs of the occupation. The Palestinian masses emerged from the heart of occupied Jerusalem to announce a new stage of Palestinian revolutionary struggle, integrated in multiple forms and methods, pouring into the river of resistance and the movement of revolutionary change on the road to victory, liberation and return.</p>
                    <p>May 15 comes this year at a time when the flame of return is rising in the hearts of Palestinian youth, students and workers, when the Palestinian resistance is galvanized in the West Bank and in occupied Palestine '48, and the valiant Palestinian resistance in the Gaza Strip accumulates its military, protective and logistical capabilities as it completes the liberation of the Gaza Strip, to protect our sea, sky and land from the planes, ships and tanks of the occupier. The capital of the Palestinian people, occupied Jerusalem, continues its proud steadfastness and confrontation of all projects of normalization, Judaization, land confiscation, home demolition and siege.</p>
                    <p>As the occupation forces continue their crimes against our people in occupied Palestine, targeting the Palestinian journalist Shireen Abu Aqleh in Jenin with live bullets, continuing its policy of daily arrests and the pursuit of Palestinian strugglers throughout occupied Palestine, and imposes a system of colonialism, apartheid and occupation, our Palestinian people also continue, with ever greater stubbornness and determination, their struggle, with eyes directed towards overcoming all obstacles and reaching a new revolutionary stage, where our struggling people gain the initiative, turning the tables on the agents of normalization, betrayal and defeat.</p>
                    <p><strong>On the Day of Palestinian Struggle, we in the Palestinian Alternative Revolutionary Path Movement reaffirm the need for unified revolutionary struggle and strengthening Palestinian and Arab popular unity in the fields of intifada and resistance, moving forward to establish a united Palestinian Arab national front in which all groups and sectors of the Palestinian people participate, led by the resistance, the forces of the Palestinian revolution, including youth, women' and labor movements inside and outside Palestine. This is the necessary condition to renew our Palestinian revolution and achieve the goals of our people to liberate our homeland, uproot the racist Zionist project, and build our future in a liberated Palestine, from the river to the sea.</strong></p>
                    <p class="strong">Long live the Day of Palestinian struggle, on the road to victory and freedom<br><br>
                        The Nakba continuesâ€¦ and therefore, the resistance continues until return and liberation<br><br>

                    <h2>Nakba 74: We Support Palestinian Refugees To Return To Their Homeland</h2>
                    <h3>What Is Nakba?</h3>
                    <p>The British occupation/mandate of Palestine (1917-1948) supported and facilitated a colonial-settler project in Palestine called Zionism. Settlers came mainly from Europe. Israel was created in 1948 on Palestinian land after Zionist militia destroyed more than 500 Palestinian villages and cities, and forced 750,000 Palestinians (3/4 of the population) out of their homeland. The refugees now number over seven million spread across the region and around the world.</p>
                    <p>This is what Palestinians call the Nakba (Catastrophe) and commemorate every year on May 15.</p>
                    <h3>Nakba As Ongoing Process Of Ethnic Cleansing</h3>
                    <p>Israel today continues its violent project of dispossessing Palestinian land and expelling and oppressing Palestinians. It refuses to allow Palestinian refugees to return to their homeland, steals land from Palestinian owners in Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Naqab, enforces a brutal siege on the Palestinian people of Gaza for more than 16 years, and discriminates against Palestinians inside Israel (occupied Palestine 1948). Palestinians are fighting back against ethnic cleansing and injustice.</p>
                    <h3>Palestinian Ongoing Resistance</h3>
                    <p>We support the struggle of our Palestinian sisters and brothers in the refugee camps and in exile and diaspora around the world to return to their homeland, and of those inside historic Palestine itself, including in Jerusalem, Gaza, the West Bank and Israel (occupied Palestine '48), to enjoy dignity, freedom and safety in their homeland.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, part of the official Palestinian leadership, namely, the Palestinian Authority, is engaged in security collaboration with the occupation and oppression of Palestinian dissent, including journalists and writers, as part and parcel of the Oslo process. We condemn the destructive policy of the PA, which acts as a subcontractor for the occupation and enables, rather than challenges, the ongoing Nakba.</p>
                    <h3>Our Vision For The Future</h3>
                    <p>We strongly believe that the Palestinian refugees must have and implement the right to return to their homeland, that Israeli settler-colonial structures should be fully dismantled, and that a new system should be developed where every person in historic Palestine can enjoy full dignity, freedom and safety regardless of their religious background. This is the political meaning of "liberation of all of Palestine, from the river to the sea". In order to make this happen, the international community must isolate the Israeli regime and hold it accountable. The United Nations has a responsibility to implement Palestinian rights, including and especially the right of Palestinian refugees to return (Resolution 194).</p>
                    <p>Canada has a role to play in achieving a positive outcome by ending its complicity in the ongoing Nakba. In 1947, Canada had a large role in formulating and passing the Partition Plan (Resolution 181) for Palestine at the UN General Assembly (The New York Times called the partition plan "The Canadian plan"), which brought about the catastrophe. Since that time, the Canadian government has continued to support Israeli occupation and oppression. It is time for these policies to come to an end.</p>

                <div class="text section">
                    <p>If the Arab regimes and their affiliated Palestinian bourgeoisie used the Fateh movement as a political and popular vehicle to secure their interests, then the Palestinian Authority, which was established in 1994, devoured the PLO and what was left of Fateh, and it became a poisoned tool, a spearhead for the project of normalization and liquidation of the Palestinian cause. Today, we are witnessing the funeral ceremonies of this institution, whose "official seal" now sits in the pockets of the Shin Bet and the Civil Administration officers. Instead of the PLO being a bridge toward return and liberation, it became a bridge crossed by the Zionist enemy to perpetuate a system of subordination and liquidation, all with the blessing of the so-called "sole legitimate representative"!</p>
                    <p>Since 1968, the Zionist enemy has sought to create what it called a "Palestinian entity" in cooperation with "high-ranking personalities" in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, from representatives of big Palestinian capitalists, tribal leaders and traditional leaders (on both banks of the Jordan River). These figures and forces were, and still are, particularly reliant on their close relationship with the Jordanian regime.</p>
                    <p>May liquidationist initiatives and projects known to the Palestinian people have been continually reproduced under countless names. The "project of self-rule administration" was at the forefront, but even as its name changed, the essence and content remained the same. These liquidation projects are tantamount to a reactionary Zionist colonial "solution," and an alternative to the revolutionary historical solution presented by the Palestinian revolution with the escalation of fedayee action: the project of liberation, return and the establishment of a democratic society throughout all of Palestine.</p>
                    <p>The essence itself remained unchanged, until this initiative was translated into reality on the ground through the signing of the Oslo accords (1993), by the leadership of Fateh, and the establishment of the Palestinian Authority (1994). The birth of this Authority was accompanied by a major transformation in the international and Arab regimes, and with the collapse (indeed, the deliberate destruction), almost completely, of the Palestine Liberation Organization and its institutions. Thus, Palestinian capitalists in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip found an opportunity to establish a rotten entity under the name of the "Palestinian Authority," relying on their political party, the Fateh movement.</p>
                    <p>The Palestinian Authority came into being as a poisoned fruit, the product of the previous absurd and monopolistic policies. A new phase of retreat and destruction began, the disastrous consequences of which we are still experiencing today. The danger of the existence of the Oslo entity (the Palestinian Authority) in this era of global neoliberalism, after the collapse of the socialist camp, the direct U.S. military occupation in the region, and the ensuing wars, lies in the fact that it has become part of the toolbox for the liquidation of the Palestinian cause. That is, the liquidation of the national liberation project at the hands of a "Palestinian entity" itself. This is because "the castle is taken from the inside," as they say. The enemy would not have been able to advance an inch without the presence of its Palestinian tool, which was provided by the leadership of the PLO and Fateh for the entire liquidation project.</p>
                    <p>This is, of course, without relieving the rest of the Palestinian factions of their responsibility, albeit to a lesser degree, for the dismantling of the Palestinian national project, especially those who established the illusions of "settlement" with the enemy and the so-called "interim program" in 1974. Those who agreed to it presented the Palestinian right wing with a pretext enabling it to walk the path of gradual concessions, in the name of "realism and tactics," leading to the sale of the Palestinian cause in its entirety.</p>
                    <p>The Palestinian experience prior to the Oslo Accords indicates that popular will, led by an armed vanguard, has always been able to confront and thwart the "self-rule" project and isolate those forces that dare to adopt this option, and even liquidate them when necessary (as was seen in the confrontation with the Village Networks in the 1970s and 1980s.) The overwhelming popular and political unity in rejecting "self-rule" and the return of King Hussein to the West Bank would have prevented the implementation of this liquidation project.</p>
                    <p>The Authority of Arab and Palestinian capitalists, seeking "economic peace," "stability" and "achieving peace through negotiations," destroyed the foundations of the Palestinian liberation project, and squeezed it into the grip of the 1% of major international traders and their agents. Therefore, the Palestinian popular classes found themselves exposed, deprived of the ability to take action or influence the outcome; rather, they became shackled in the economic, political and social sense, marginalized and neglected, constrained by the contours of the "new Palestinian regime" established by the Fateh party in partnership with the Palestinian "private sector," with the clear complicity of the batallions of washed-up, opportunistic intellectuals.</p>
                    <p>The Palestinian popular classes were able, during the stage of the revolutionary tide, to curb the occupation's incursions, limit the influence of the oil regimes in the Palestinian arena, and deter the residents of the palaces from liquidating Palestinian rights â€” even through assassinations or threats of physical liquidation. After 1993, they were gradually stripped of this ability and denied even the mechanisms of peaceful change in order to restore their confiscated role.</p>
                    <p>The forces propelling Oslo destroyed what remained of the foundations and bases of the Palestinian national economy, dismantled the all-encompassing, inclusive political and national institutions, and harnessed the Palestinian people to agreements, laws, taxes and debts that primarily affected farmers, fishers, impoverished workers and employees, and then reproduced the Palestinian security institutions for a second time after the intifada in 2005. This project was sponsored by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and was supervised directly by U.S. General Keith Dayton, known for his phrase, "the new Palestinian"!</p>
                    <p>If we add to all of this the preceding and systematic destruction of all popular organizations and union federations inside and outside Palestine, and the confiscation of the voice of our people in occupied Palestine '48 and in exile and diaspora, the picture before us becomes clearer and more dangerous:</p>
                    <p>A process of bulldozing the Palestinian liberation movement was carefully drawn up and engineered. This was accompanied by the destruction of the institutions of the Palestine Liberation Organization, emptying them of their national and democratic content, until the PLO was transformed into a private farm for Mahmoud Abbas and his cronies. In a more precise sense, the rights of the popular classes in the Palestinian economy and in the PLO were robbed.</p>
                    <p>The Oslo entity, then, came as a ready-made recipe for the destruction of the Palestinian national movement, removing it from the scene. This was accompanied by the proliferation of the phenomenon of "non-governmental organizations" in our society and took the place of the student, feminist and labor movement, reproducing them instead according to liberal and Western concepts and visions, stripped of their national liberation content.</p>
                    <p>The Oslo regime constitutes the most dangerous Palestinian angle of the project to liquidate the Palestinian cause, and presents the most subordinate image to imperialism and Zionism within the framework of the official Arab regimes. It is the weakest side of the Camp David â€” Wadi Araba â€” Oslo triangle, which is sponsored by the United States and Saudi Arabia in particular, because it provides the Zionist discourse with official Palestinian "legitimacy." Thus, the PLO was transformed from a locomotive for liberation into a private farm for merchants, brokers and the "sacred" security coordination group.</p>
                    <p>The exit from this complex Palestinian reality will not happen without a long revolutionary struggle and a unified Palestinian and Arab popular will that imposes the rights of the Palestinian people once more, returning the struggle to its fundamentals. This must be led by the Palestinian armed resistance and the prisoners' movement, in which the forces of popular struggle and mobilization inside Palestine and in the diaspora fully participate.</p>
